                              <p>When registering for Maker Faire Orlando, the forms are designed for maker exhibits, and so the terminology needs a bit of translation.
                                The "Maker" is the team, and the "Exhibit" is the robot or robots. Each "maker" will get one pass to the event, and after you are approved,
                                you will be able to add "helpers" for the rest of your team to get everyone passes.
                                You do not need to register each member of your team as a maker, and if you have more than one robot, you are welcome to do all of them in one exhibit -
                                or break them into separate exhibits, your choice.<br><br>If you have questions on this registration, you can email us
                                at {{site.contact_email}} OR email the broader Maker Faire Orlando team at makers@makerfaireorlando.com<br><br>We know that registering on both buildersdb AND
                                the Maker Faire Orlando site is a lot of process, and we appreciate you helping us make it happen.</p>

            Robot check in/safety is available starting Friday afternoon as well as limited safety checks on Saturday morning.  We encourage all who can come Friday to do so to insure the event runs on time.
          Volunteers to help setup/tear-down the arenas on the days before are greatly appreciated, as are volunteers to help keep the event running! Whether it be judging, robot wrangling, or crowd control, etc, any help that can be given is fantastic.
          </p>



          <p>
          Maker Faire is a family-friendly event with lots to do for all ages. Invite family and friends to watch you battle and enjoy all the Maker Faire has to offer. <a href="https://www.makerfaireorlando.com">Learn More!</a>
