                              <p>When registering for Maker Faire Orlando, the forms are designed for maker exhibits, and so the terminology needs a bit of translation.
                                The "Maker" is the team, and the "Exhibit" is the robot or robots. Each "maker" will get one pass to the event, and after you are approved,
                                you will be able to add "helpers" for the rest of your team to get everyone passes.
                                You do not need to register each member of your team as a maker, and if you have more than one robot, you are welcome to do all of them in one exhibit -
                                or break them into separate exhibits, your choice.<br><br>If you have questions on this registration, you can email us
                                at contact@robotruckus.org OR email the broader Maker Faire Orlando team at makers@makerfaireorlando.com<br><br>We know that registering on both buildersdb AND
                                the Maker Faire Orlando site is a lot of process, and we appreciate you helping us make it happen.</p>

            Insect battles will be run in an 8'x8' arena, which has a non-ferrous floor with a pit in one corner. Bigger bots will be run in an 16'x32' arena which has a steel floor. Everything up to 15lbs will be full contact, and the 30s and 250s will be "sportsman" style.
            Insect weightclasses will be double-elimination, and 15s, 30s, and 250s will be a pools fight format. Relevant links: <a href="/assets/pdf/robot_ruckus_match_rules.pdf">Match Procedures</a> and <a href="assets/pdf/RobotRuckus_ConstructionSpecs.pdf">Construction Specs</a>

          Entry fees are $20 for insects and 15lb, $30 for 30lb, and $50 for 250lb Sportsman. Due to time and space constraints, a team may only enter robots into either the insect weightclasses or the bigger weightclasses. You may not compete in both arenas. Weekend Maker Faire Orlando passes will be given to each team member. We will email you to complete the Maker Faire Orlando registration which will be required to get event credentials. This step MUST be done to receive passes for Maker Faire Orlando! The process is being simplified for 2021, and we will email details when they are available.
